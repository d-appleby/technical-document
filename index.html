          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure
          a web page and its content.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
          either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
          fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
          and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active
          participant in the World Wide Web.

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe
          the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes
          how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on
          other media.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
          across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.

          JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are
          pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with
          animation, etc.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example:</li>
        </ul>

          if (condition) {
          <br />
          /* code to run if condition is true*/

          As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user
          interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the
          web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments.
          For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM.
          React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and
          utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development
          frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we're working
          with that colloquial understanding.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example:</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
          const header = (
          <br />
          &lt;header&gt;
          <br />
          &lt;h1&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/h1&gt;
          <br />
          &lt;/header&gt;

        <p>
          All developers will use some kind of version control system (VCS), a
          tool to allow them to collaborate with other developers on a project
          without the danger of them overwriting each other's work, and roll
          back to previous versions of the code base if a problem is discovered
          later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most popular VCS (at least among web developers) is Git, along
          with GitHub, a site that provides hosting for your repositories and
          several tools for working with them. This module aims to teach you
          what you need to know about both of them.
        </p>

          <br />
          git config -global user.email "[email address]"
